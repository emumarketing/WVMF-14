				<h2>Night Beats</h2>
				<p>
					Night Beats are an American Psychedelic, Garage and Soul group based out of Seattle, Washington. The group consists of Lee Blackwell (Lead Guitar, Vocals), James Traeger (Drums) and Tarek Wegner (Bass). Night Beats incorporate sounds of early R&B, Texas Psychedelic Rock, UK Blues, Folk and Soul<br /><br />
					Danny Lee "Blackwell" originally from Dallas, Texas founded Night Beats in 2009 when James Traeger moved from Austin, Texas to Seattle, Washington. Named as an homage to Sam Cooke's Magnum Opus[3] the then 2-piece picked up Tarek Wegner who was living in Seattle. The Night Beats toured extensively early on completing multiple North American tours during 2010 and were signed within weeks of self releasing their debut EP, the H-Bomb EP. Picked up by Chicago's Trouble in Mind Records (Ty Segall, Fresh and Only's, Hex Dispensers, etc.).

				<h2>Wampire</h2>
				<p>After forming Wampire, Rocky Tinder and Eric Phipps steadily began to make a name for themselves in the same Portland, OR, scene that has
				produced labelmates STRFKR as well as Unknown Mortal Orchestra.<br /><br />

				It makes sense, then, that Wampire came to Polyvinyl's attention when the duo opened for STRFKR at a hometown Portland show and that UMO's bassist Jacob Portrait produced Wampire's debut full-length, Curiosity.<br /><br />

				The choice of Portrait was a natural one, with both Tinder and Phipps believing he'd be able to contribute almost as much to the record as they would. And so, in mid-August Tinder and Phipps each brought fragments of song ideas into the studio,
				before deconstructing, re-arranging, and fitting them back together piece by piece -- at times lyrics and melodies were thrown out, brought back from the dead, or improvised on the spot.

				<h2>Black Pistol Fire</h2>
				<p>Black Pistol Fire is a Canadian Rock and Roll duo that split's time between Toronto, Ontario and Austin, Texas. Their wild and energetic rock-and-roll sound has been described as a mix of classic southern rock and garage punk, garnering comparisons to early Kings of Leon, Creedence Clearwater Revival, The White Stripes, and Clutch. It's clear that the band's sound spans many different eras and subgenres, relying on a classic rock and roll sound that has been updated for our modern times. 
				<br /><br />
				Black Pistol Fire features Kevin McKeown on Guitar/Lead Vocals and Eric Owen on Drums. The two have been friends since kindergarten and began playing music together when they discovered a shared passion for rock and roll music in high school. The two became founding members of rock and roll trio The Shenanigans. With The Shenanigans, they recorded an LP titled Bombshell Baby. After things with The Shenanigans and Toronto got stale, the two wanted a change of scenery and to try out something new. They then packed up their instruments and a bag of clothes and headed south. The band finally settled down in Austin, Texas in 2009 and Black Pistol Fire was born.

				<h2>Burnin' Moonlight</h2>
				<p>One thing for certain about the acoustic trio Burnin' Moonlight - they love all kinds of music and their snappy stage banter and lively performance is infectious and engaging.  In October 2011, these three jammed together for an impromptu 4 hour gig on a flatbed trailer at a pumpkin patch - they haven't stopped playing since.  They've played the High &amp; Dry Bluegrass Festival in Bend for several years, many other Central Oregon venues and events, and a blues festival in Nevada.  Their CD "Good Wood" was released in November 2013. 
					<br /><br />
					With diverse musical history, they shift smoothly between spirited traditional bluegrass, rootsy folk, a little country, swing and downright lowdown blues. Scott Foxx lets it fly with fiery fiddle, stunning, hard-driving rhythm guitar and brilliant solos. Jim Roy cuts loose with his Piedmont fingerstyle guitar and rippin' mandolin solos. Maggie Jackson's bass and rhythm guitar keep a steady beat when she's not pickin' bluegrass and blues banjo. Topping off the instrumental collage, Maggie and Jim share sweet, soulful vocal leads and harmonies. </p>

				<h2>Green Garter Band</h2>
				<p>The Oregon Athletic Bands maintain two 12-member scholarship groups known as the Green Garter Band (GGB) and the Yellow Garter Band (YGB). The Garter Bands are the most versatile and elite athletic musical groups on campus. Often seen performing around the stadium before football games, the GGB and YGB play everything from "Louie Louie" to Disney's "Duck Tales." From funk to rock to hip hop, the GGB plays hundreds of high-energy student-arranged songs to entertain the hundreds of thousands they perform to every year.<br /><br />
				The Green Garter Band performs for all women's volleyball games and selected women's basketball games, as well as many other performances on and off campus. Student leadership and active student group involvement have made these groups truly exceptional. A faculty member advises the group, but student directors organize all tune selection, rehearsals and performances.</p>

				<h2>Sky Country</h2>
				<p>This is the warm dessert surf music particular to california - The natural result of being raised in the lineages of 60's surf rock culture, yet lodged deeply into that pocket of warm 70's tones with the verbed out country influence and yet other obscure realms too... Sky country humbly blasts into a frontier in new california music. Highlights of 2012-2013 included opening for Fishbone, Entrance Band, Linda Perhacs, and Rock n' Roll Legend, Leon Russel.
				<br /><br />
				Sky Coiuntry is Nico Georis on vintage, keyboards &amp; guitar. Adam Zerbe on Bass. Will Condon on the Drums.</p>

				<h2>On The Rocks</h2>
				<p>On The Rocks was founded in 1999 by Leo DaSilva and Peter Hollens when they attended the University of Oregon. The group established itself through five albums with an EP, a viral video of Lady Gaga's Bad Romance, and appearances on NBC's show "The Sing Off". And now they are a new group of twelve living up to their past of fame and notoriety. You may ask us, "Why don't you sing Lady Gaga?" or "Where are the guys from the 'Sing Off'?" Sadly those days are gone. Those who graduated left us a great legacy and we look up to their talent every time we sing. But talent never graduates. Talent built this group from a time before the boom of TV shows and viral videos, because having the time of our lives has always been the goal and will continue to be forever. So know this: Every time we perform, we step on stage with the vigor of every man who has ever sang in our name. On. The. Rocks.</p>

				<h2>Mozzo Kush</h2>
				<p>Mozzo Kush is a Pacific Grove based rock band who have been playing together since 2009. They blend their diverse influences, both classic and modern, to create their own sound as if "Red Hot Chili Peppers and The Strokes had a baby, and that baby grew up listening to Indie rock." While still attending secondary school, the band released its first two studio albums, "Mozzo Kush" and "Spirit Bear" as compact disc and digital release. After graduation drummer Taylor Jones moved up north to further his education, and the band started playing gigs and writing with Edison Cho. Currently Mozzo Kush is busy writing new songs and practicing for a series of gigs in the northwest!</p>
